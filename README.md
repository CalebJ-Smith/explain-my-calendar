# Explain My Calendar
I've been looking for a side project to work on, and recently decided that Go and ReactJS are two tools that I need to have in my toolbelt. 
So, I'm getting practice with them by creating a website that pulls in data from my Google Calendar and analyzes it, then displays a summary of how I've spent my time the past week as a dashboard.

# To run: 
Install Go and npm. Then,  
In `explain-my-calendar/backend`:  
`go run .`  
In `explain-my-calendar/frontend`:   
`npm start`
